This directory contains a few examples of code written for both NodeJS and React.

The code is partly taken from side projects I've worked on in the past, and partly written specifically to show an understanding of how I architect React applications. Please refer to `nodejs/config` (a standalone module from one of my personal projects) for a more thoroughly implemented module. It's a simple class, but should demonstrate an understanding of SOLID principles and testing.

Unfortunately the React stuff is not as well implemented as I would have liked. Error handling, testing and actual functioning demonstration would have been helpful had I had more time.
